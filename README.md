# Open Dataset License (ODsL) - Work in progress
A work-in-progress suggestion for an open dataset license. 

ODsL aims to provide a set of licenses for datasets and for code used to generate datasets that is more adequate than existing licenses to the consequences of current and possible future uses and applications of datasets and the code used to generate datasets.


## Project scope

This repository is meant to house several distinct components of the ODsL project:
* A summary discussion regarding the necessity of such a set of licenses and its feasible impact.
* A summary discussion regarding what issues such a set of licenses should address.
* A summary discussion regarding the structure and division to distinct licenses of such a set of licenses.
* A summary discussion regarding impact and adoption techniques and cooperation with relevant organizations.
* Work in progress drafts of the different licenses composing such a set of licenses.


## Main points

### Necessity

### Addressed issues

### Structure and division

### Impact and adoption


## Human-readable summaries

The language in these human-readable summaries (of a yet non-existent set of licenses of legal value) borrows heavilly from the human-readable summaries of the different ODbL licenses. We humbly thank the great ODbL project for the inspiration.

### Open Dataset License (ODsL)

You are free **to share** - to copy and distribute the dataset - and **to adapt** - to modify, transform and add to the dataset - as long as you:

* Attribute: You must attribute any shared copy or distribution of the dataset, or any modified, transformed or extended form of the dataset, in the manner specified in the ODsL. Furthermore, for any redistribution of the dataset, or any modified, transformed or extended form of the dataset, you must make clear to others the license of the dataset and keep intact any notices on the original dataset.
* Share-Alike: If you publicly publish any adapted version of this dataset, or works produced from an adapted dataset, you must also offer that adapted dataset under the ODsL.
* Keep open: If you redistribute the ODsL, or an adapted version of it, then you may use technological measures that restrict the work (such as DRM) as long as you also redistribute a version without such measures, and give a notice of it existence in any such distribtion.

### Open Dataset Generation License (ODsGL)
